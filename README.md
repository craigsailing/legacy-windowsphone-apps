# legacy-windowsphone-apps

There are 2 mobile applications here for legacy Windows Phone 8.x. 
1) Somple GribViewer that can display sailing gribs from sources like saildocs. Usefull if anyone needs to decode grib files with C# and display them on a map.
2) NMEA Reader. This can read Instrument NMEA data from WiFi or Bluetooth bluetooth. This supported NMEA0813. Usefull if you need to read a TCP/UDP and decode NMEA data. 

There is no new development on these as the platform is retired now with few users.
